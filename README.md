# Capstone-Project-Bike-Rental-Company-Customer-Insights
This was my first attempt at a data analyst project.  It contains lots of learning and unprofessionalism. I made this for my Data Analyst Certification.  I made with only myself in mind as my audience and end-user as I focused on trying to take the things I had been learning from videos and transfer them to applied knowledge.  It's an absolute mess.  I had hoped and do hope to clean it up some time.  But for now, I would rather have work out there that shows that I am thorough, ask a lot of question,s and enjoy being wrong and surprised (and gaining new insights from it) than wait until cleaning this up makes it to the top of my priority list.

This project used R for my data cleaning, data transformation, and hypotheses testing processes.  Logs of that can be found in the files I uploaded.  It ended with a visualization over in Tableau that I cannot upload here because of size.
