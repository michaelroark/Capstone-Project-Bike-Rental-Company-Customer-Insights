# Capstone-Project-Bike-Rental-Company-Customer-Insights
This was my first attempt at a data analyst project.  It contains lots of learning and unprofessionalism. I made this for my Data Analyst Certification.  I made with only myself in mind as my audience and end-user as I focused on trying to take the things I had been learning from videos and transfer them to applied knowledge.  It's an absolute mess.  I had hoped and do hope to clean it up some time.  But for now, I would rather have work out there that shows that I am thorough, ask a lot of question,s and enjoy being wrong and surprised (and gaining new insights from it) than wait until cleaning this up makes it to the top of my priority list.
